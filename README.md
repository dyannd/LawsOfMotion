# LawsOfMotion

My favorite pesonal project so far :). I tried to incorporate knowledge from my major to Web Design :D. The web shows you basics on Laws of Motions, but in a quite more interactive manner. I hope it can gets you interested in Physics!

It is a 2-weeks project for me, since I am relatively fresh to all the technologies. The website was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. It is a project I use to concrete my knowledge in these areas!

Enjoy!
